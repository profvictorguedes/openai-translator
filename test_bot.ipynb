Open AI and Cognitive Search shut down the public IP address, thus there is not public interface endpoint available anymore. \\n \\n \\n \\n  Deploy\\n \\n The bicep file will deploy following Azure Resources. \\n \\n Let's deploy and confirm how it works. I create a resource group in East US region for my own test. \\n \\n \\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/openai-enterprise-iac\\n cd  openai-enterprise-iac\\naz group create  -n  openaitest  -l  eastus\\naz deployment group create  -g  openaitest  -f  . \\\\i nfra \\\\m ain.bicep\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Enter fullscreen mode \\n \\n \\n Exit fullscreen mode \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Once I run the commend above, I see the deployment started. \\n Wait until the deployment completes. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Test\\n \\n Let's see if the deployment was succeeded. \\n \\n \\n \\n  Azure Open AI\\n \\n Let's try public access first. \\n I could create a deployment without any issue. But when I try from the Chat playground in my Azure Portal, I see the following error. \\n \\n How about access via the Web API? \\n From an advanced tool of the App Service, I login to Bash session, and first I ping the service URL. \\n \\n I see the private IP address assigned to the Private Endpoint is returend. \\n Then I use curl command to send request to the endpoint. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          Top comments  (0) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Subscribe \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Personal \\n Trusted User \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        Create template\\n       \\n Templates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use. \\n \\n \\n \\n Submit \\n Preview \\n Dismiss \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Code of Conduct \\n • \\n Report abuse \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        Are you sure you want to hide this comment?
